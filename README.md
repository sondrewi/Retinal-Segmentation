Project completed as part of Applied AI in Medical Imaging course at UCL. This was a group project, but the reports were individual. I was responsible for implementation of the multitask and mixture models in addition to writing the training functions and the functions used to evaluate each model on test set and write to file (the actual Dice and Hausdorff functions were written by another group member).
